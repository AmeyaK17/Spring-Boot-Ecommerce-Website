## Help needed in:
- Somehow the POST and PUT functionality is not working, I checked it multiple times, but still wasn't able to figure out the bug
- I tried implementing Spring security in another project, and there it is showing ssome error related to Bean creation. I tried solving it by taking help from the internet, but was unsuccessful. I have attached that second project as well
